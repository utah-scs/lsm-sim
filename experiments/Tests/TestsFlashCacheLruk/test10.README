run this test:

../../lsm-sim -a 1 -w 0 -p flashcache -F 524290 -D 524290 -f ./test7

In this test we want to check that we actually move from DRAM to FLASH when
we have enough credits and there is fre space in Flash

result:

#accesses 2
#global hits 17
#dram hits 17
#flash hits 0
hit rate 0
#writes to flash 1
credit limit 0
#bytes written to flash 524288
