run this test:

../../lsm-sim -a 1 -w 0 -p flashcache -F 524290 -D 524290 -f ./test6

In this test there is enough space in the flash, however, there is not 
enough credit; hence, we should evict from the DRAM.

result:

#accesses 2
#global hits 0
#dram hits 0
#flash hits 0
hit rate 0
#writes to flash 0
credit limit 1
#bytes written to flash 0
