run this test:

../../lsm-sim -a 1 -w 0 -p clock -s 45 -f ./test2

0.05,1,1,5,10,100,1
0.1,1,1,5,10,101,1
0.15,1,1,5,10,102,1
0.2,1,1,5,10,100,1
0.3,1,1,5,10,103,1
0.35,1,1,5,10,101,1

In this test the first 3 elements are inserted with a 0 value. In the forth line there
is a hit, and the value matching kid = 100 is increased to 15. In the fifth line a new
object arrives and there is an eviction from the dram - the element which is evicted is 
kid = 101 and therefore, there is no hit in the last line

result:

global_mem 45
clock max value 15
#accesses 6
#global hits 1
hit rate 0.166667
noZeros 0
